          <h2>About</h2>  
        <p>Hi there, I’m Lauren, a UI/UX designer and front-end web developer. 
          I grew up in small town Iowa, where many of my memories are within eyesight of a corn field. 
          Throughout my whole life, I always loved creating. As a child you would find me frequently drawing a character from a book I was reading, or writing a science-fiction story to show my science-fiction obsessed father. 
          I also was a curious child and loved learning, something I gratefully learned from my parents, and often I would have books checked out from the library about my favorite animal or a science topic. 
          </p>  
          <p>With both the arts and sciences being equally intriguing to me, I sought to find a career that combined my passion for both. 
            I began studying at the University of Iowa, and step by step, through both classes and personal exploration, I learned about web design,
             front-end development, then UI/UX design. I knew then that things fell into place, and graduated with a B.S in informatics with a special focus on 
             Human-Computer Interaction, and minors in art, computer science, and English. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently interning for Sandia National Labs, where for nearly the last 2 years I have been working as a UX researcher and web designer. 
            I’m available for full-time roles, freelance projects, and contracts.
            If you think that I would be a great fit on your team, please reach out to me!
          </p>
