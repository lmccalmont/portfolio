          <h2>The assignment</h2>  
        <p>After spending about half the semester going through Unity tutorials, we were 
            given a broad assignment: create any VR experience that we wish. Being a fan of horror, I pretty quickly thought of 
            making a horror game. 
        </p>  
        <h2>Game Concept</h2> 
          <p>Player is camping in the woods when they hear a noise. 
            They decide it's best to get out of the woods, but they cannot find their car keys. 
            While being chased by a ghost spider that only lurks in the dark, the player must find their keys and their car to escape.
            In other words, light sources are safe areas. 
          </p>
          <h2>Beginning Work</h2>
          <p>
            Once my project partner and I were happy with the game concept, we knew that with the set deadline we had to approach this with a plan. 
            We made a list of what was necessary for the game function and what would be “nice to have”. A rough timeline of how the game was
             developed is:
          </p>
          <div id="timeline">
          <ul>
            <li>Continuous movement</li>
            <li>Importing assets we thought would be useful</li>
            <li>Monster (spider) that followed player</li>
            <li>Spider that would de-spawn near light source and "kill" player if collided with</li>
            <li>Respawning spider</li>
            <li>Random spawning truck and key</li>
            <li>Game over logic (both win and lose)</li>
            <li>Audio</li>
            <li>UI & finishing touches</li>
          </ul>
          </div>
          <h2>Final Result</h2>
          <p>Both my project partner and I are proud of the result. This was both of our first time creating any type of game or working with VR. 
            We met all of our “must-have” objectives and even some extra. The player is chased through the woods by a ghost spider. 
            The player can explore and find a car key and then get to the pickup truck (which both spawn is a few random locations each game) to escape. 
            Light sources 
        </p>
        <p>I learned a ton about Unity, C#, and Virtual Reality and really enjoyed the creative process.
